# Crossword Layout Generator - Open Source
## Major differences...
...compared to Michael Wehar's code.

The crossword layout generator has been designed to be run stand-alone on a web page, and the results put into [LaTeX cwpuzzle](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/gene/crossword/).

Go to the [working website](crossword.henley.id.au), or download the code and open the index.html file in your browser.

Options are provided for the various optimisation parameters, so that you can generate different crossword layouts for the same set of inputs.

## Introduction

A crossword consists of clues, answers, and a layout:
- The answers are the hidden words that the player is trying to guess.
- Each answer has a clue which is a sentence or phrase that helps the player to guess the associated answer.
- The **crossword layout** describes where the answers are located in a two-dimensional grid.

This crossword layout generator takes in a list of answers and outputs a crossword layout.  Our program **does not** generate the answers or the clues.

## Input and Output Format

An input is a list of answers in a JSON format.  The clues can optionally be included with the input.

Here is an example input:

`[{"clue":"that which is established as a rule or model by authority, custom, or general consent","answer":"standard"},{"clue":"a machine that computes","answer":"computer"},{"clue":"the collective designation of items for a particular purpose","answer":"equipment"},{"clue":"an opening or entrance to an inclosed place","answer":"port"},{"clue":"a point where two things can connect and interact","answer":"interface"}]`

The output is a crossword layout.  That is, we associate a position, startx, starty, and orientation with each answer.

Here is an example output:

`[{"clue":"the collective designation of items for a particular purpose","answer":"equipment","startx":1,"starty":4,"position":1,"orientation":"across"},{"clue":"an opening or entrance to an inclosed place","answer":"port","startx":5,"starty":4,"position":2,"orientation":"down"},{"clue":"that which is established as a rule or model by authority, custom, or general consent","answer":"standard","startx":8,"starty":1,"position":3,"orientation":"down"},{"clue":"a machine that computes","answer":"computer","startx":3,"starty":2,"position":4,"orientation":"across"},{"clue":"a point where two things can connect and interact","answer":"interface","startx":1,"starty":1,"position":5,"orientation":"down"}]`

## Getting Started

**Step 1:** Add the following line to the head of your html document:

`<script src="layout_generator.js"></script>`

**Step 2:** In the body of your html document, you can add the following JavaScript:

```
<script>
...
var layout = generateLayout(input_json);
var rows = layout.rows;
var cols = layout.cols;
var table = layout.table; // table as two-dimensional array
var output_html = layout.table_string; // table as plain text (with HTML line breaks)
var output_json = layout.result; // words along with orientation, position, startx, and starty
...
</script>
```


## Demo Website

The demo website's source code can be found in `index.html`.

The demo website shows:

- how to generate the crossword layout in a JSON format

- how to generate the crossword layout in a plain text grid format (using HTML line breaks).

- how to turn your crossword layout into a **word search puzzle** with horizontal and vertical answers.


## Information for Advanced Users

- The generated layouts don't always contain all of the input words.  If a word does not appear in the layout, then its orientation attribute will be set to "none".

- The generated crossword layouts are not always connected.  Occasionally, there will be islands of disconnected words.

- The program is efficient on small word lists, but it runs noticably slower when the list contains more than 100 words.

- We are still exploring potential ways to evaluate the quality of the generated crossword layouts.
